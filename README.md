# COMP790_UnityCardBoard

## Game description

My customized game is based on step 5. If the user can use the ball to hit the yellow area in the center, the target will disappear and produce a fire explosion effect. (This effect is borrowed from the [Unity Particle Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-particle-pack-127325#releases))

It's a game because it contains fixed rule (hit and win), variable outcomes and different values (winning with special effects and losing without), player effort (players need to move the head to the correct position to hit the target), attachment of the player to the outcome (happy to win and see the visual effect), and negotiable consequences (This game's rules can be played with or without real-life consequences).
